# CodeQL Security Scanning Workflow
#
# CodeQL is GitHub's semantic code analysis engine that helps discover vulnerabilities across a codebase.
# It analyzes code to find security issues, bugs, and code quality problems by building a database
# of the code structure and running security queries against it.
#
# This workflow performs automated security scanning on the BenchMARL codebase to:
# - Detect common security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, command injection, etc.)
# - Identify potential bugs and code quality issues
# - Provide security insights in GitHub Security tab
# - Block PRs with critical security findings (optional)
#
# For more information see:

on:
  # Scan on push to main branch to catch security issues in production code
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Scan pull requests targeting main to prevent merging vulnerable code
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Run weekly scans on Monday at 9:00 AM UTC to catch newly discovered vulnerabilities
  # in dependencies and emerging security patterns

        # Aligns with existing test matrix in unit_tests.yml

    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Set up Python environment
    # CodeQL needs the proper Python version to analyze Python-specific patterns
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    # Step 3: Install Python dependencies
    # CodeQL performs better analysis when dependencies are installed,
    # allowing it to understand the full context of imports and library usage
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        # Install core dependencies without running full test suite installation

        pip install torch torchrl tensordict || true

    # Step 4: Initialize CodeQL
    # Sets up the CodeQL tools and creates a database of the codebase for analysis
    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
      with:
        # Specify Python as the language to analyze
        languages: python

        # Use default CodeQL query suites
        # 'default' includes: security-extended, security-and-quality
        # You can also use: 'security-extended' or 'security-and-quality'
        queries: security-and-quality

        # Optional: Specify additional query packs
        # packs: codeql/python-queries:AlertSuppression.ql

    # Step 5: Autobuild
    # CodeQL attempts to automatically build the codebase
    # For Python, this typically involves discovering dependencies and structure
    - name: Autobuild
      uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v3

    # Step 6: Perform CodeQL Analysis
    # Runs security queries against the code database and uploads results
    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
      with:
        # Specify the category for multi-language/multi-matrix results organization

        # Optional: Fail the workflow if vulnerabilities are found
        # Uncomment the following line to block PRs with security issues

    # Step 7: Upload CodeQL results as artifacts (optional)
    # Useful for offline analysis or custom processing
